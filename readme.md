# Maji's Simple Giveaway Script

1. Place your webhook inside config.lua
2. Change according to the GiveawayNumber the "th" in server/main.lua at line 56. (You wouldn't want the 31th person to be logged, but the 31st, if you wanted the 31st player to win the giveaway)

## Simple as that, can be placed inside your [standalone] folder. 


# Enjoy :)
